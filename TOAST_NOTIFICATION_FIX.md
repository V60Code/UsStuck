# Toast Notification Size Fix

## Problem
The "Gemini AI siap digunakan" (Gemini AI is ready to use) notification was too large and intrusive, taking up too much screen space and potentially disrupting the user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reduced Toast Size
**File:** `src/scripts/views/ask-ai/ask-ai-view.js`
- **Padding:** Reduced from `12px 24px` to `8px 16px`
- **Font Size:** Reduced from `14px` to `12px`
- **Border Radius:** Reduced from `8px` to `6px`
- **Box Shadow:** Made more subtle by reducing blur from `12px` to `8px` and opacity from `0.3` to `0.2`

### 2. Added Size Constraints
- **Max Width:** Added `300px` maximum width to prevent overly wide notifications
- **Text Handling:** Added `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden`, and `text-overflow: ellipsis` to handle long text gracefully
- **Text Alignment:** Centered text for better visual balance

### 3. Reduced Display Duration
**File:** `src/scripts/presenters/ask-ai/ask-ai-presenter.js`
- **Duration:** Reduced from `3000ms` (3 seconds) to `2000ms` (2 seconds)
- This makes the notification less intrusive while still providing adequate time for users to read the message

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
- Large, prominent notification
- 3-second display duration
- Potentially overwhelming for users

### After:
- Compact, subtle notification
- 2-second display duration
- Better user experience with less visual disruption
- Maintains readability while being less intrusive

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes:
```css
.toast {
  padding: 8px 16px;           /* Reduced from 12px 24px */
  border-radius: 6px;          /* Reduced from 8px */
  font-size: 12px;             /* Reduced from 14px */
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  /* More subtle */
  max-width: 300px;            /* Added constraint */
  text-align: center;          /* Better alignment */
  white-space: nowrap;         /* Prevent wrapping */
  overflow: hidden;            /* Hide overflow */
  text-overflow: ellipsis;     /* Show ellipsis for long text */
}
```

### JavaScript Changes:
```javascript
// Reduced timeout from 3000ms to 2000ms
setTimeout(() => {
  toast.classList.remove('show');
  setTimeout(() => document.body.removeChild(toast), 300);
}, 2000);  // Changed from 3000
```

## Benefits

1. **Less Intrusive:** Smaller size doesn't dominate the screen
2. **Faster Dismissal:** 2-second duration is sufficient for reading
3. **Better UX:** Users can continue their workflow with minimal interruption
4. **Responsive Design:** Max-width ensures good display on various screen sizes
5. **Text Handling:** Graceful handling of long notification messages

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to the Ask AI page
3. Observe the "Gemini AI siap digunakan" notification
4. Confirm it appears smaller and dismisses after 2 seconds
5. Test with different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding different toast types (success, warning, error) with appropriate colors
- Implement toast stacking for multiple simultaneous notifications
- Add option for users to manually dismiss notifications
- Consider adding subtle animations for better visual feedback
