# Netlify Build Fix - ES Module Error Resolution

## Problem Description

The Netlify deployment was failing with the following error:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/opt/build/repo/package.json' contains "type": "module".
```

## Root Cause

The `prepare-deploy.js` script was using CommonJS syntax (`require()`) while the project was configured as an ES module in `package.json` with `"type": "module"`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated prepare-deploy.js to ES Module Syntax

**Before (CommonJS):**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
```

**After (ES Module):**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

// Get __dirname equivalent in ES modules
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

- âœ… Replaced `require()` with `import` statements
- âœ… Added `fileURLToPath` import for `__dirname` equivalent
- âœ… Maintained all existing functionality
- âœ… Preserved error handling and logging

## Verification

### Local Testing Results
```bash
npm run prepare-deploy  # âœ… Success
npm run build          # âœ… Success
```

### Build Output
- âœ… Files copied successfully to multiple locations
- âœ… Vite build completed without errors
- âœ… All assets generated correctly

## Deployment Instructions

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your changes to your Git repository
2. Netlify will automatically trigger a new build
3. The build should now complete successfully

### Manual Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload the `dist/` folder to Netlify
3. Verify `hadits.json` is accessible at your domain

## Expected Results

After this fix, your Netlify deployment should:

1. âœ… Complete the build process without errors
2. âœ… Successfully copy `hadits.json` to multiple locations
3. âœ… Make the hadith data accessible at:
   - `https://yoursite.netlify.app/hadits.json`
   - `https://yoursite.netlify.app/public/hadits.json`

## File Locations

The `hadits.json` file will be available at these paths:
- `/hadits.json` (root level)
- `/public/hadits.json` (public directory)
- `/src/public/hadits.json` (Vite public directory)

## Additional Benefits

This fix also ensures:
- âœ… Better compatibility with modern JavaScript standards
- âœ… Consistent module system throughout the project
- âœ… Future-proof code structure
- âœ… Improved build performance

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure Netlify is using Node.js 18+ (configured in netlify.toml)
2. **Verify File Paths**: Confirm `src/scripts/data/hadits.json` exists
3. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any new error messages in Netlify build logs
4. **Clear Cache**: Try a fresh deployment with cleared cache

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next Netlify deployment
2. Test the application functionality
3. Verify hadith data loading works correctly
4. Consider implementing additional optimizations if needed
